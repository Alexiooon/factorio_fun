    """Crafting recipe object.

    Class defining a single crafting recipe, which is set at initialization by
    its name. A KeyError will be raised if the recipe cannot be found.

    It has the following attributes:
      recipe (dict): Contains the actual recipe data.
      name (str):    Name of the crafting recipe.
      time (float):  Base crafting time of the recipe.
      input (dict):  Input items and their quantities.
      output (dict): Output items and their quantities.

    Since it inherits from the Mapping ABC, it can be treated as an immutable
    dictionary - What goes into the recipe (components, crafting time etc.)
    cannot be altered. The recipe itself can be changed though by simply
    updating the "recipe" attribute.

    For the dictionary part, it can be subscriptable to get any of its relevant
    attributes, e.g. recipe("Sulfur")["input"] gets the inputs to Sulfur recipe.
